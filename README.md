# Machine Learning Number Recognition

This application is a simple digit recognizer. The user is drawing a digit on canvas, and machine predicts the digit. Simplicity is essential because it allows us to see the big picture rather than focus on details.

The frontend part is built with a Vite.js React, and deployed to github pages. The machine learning part uses Python for the back-end application and is deployed on cloud.

To keep things simple, I used the most popular and easy-to-reproduce technologies.

The core part of that app is the k-nearest neighbors algorithm guessing the drawn number.
